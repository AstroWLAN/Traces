        "content": "The process of handwriting is important for the growth and cognitive development of both young and older individuals. Particularly for children, handwriting not only improves memory, reading skills, and critical thinking, helping them to better absorb information, but also develops motor skills. Handwriting practice sharpens fine motor control, improves hand-eye coordination, and strengthens hand muscles."

        "content": "Tracing sheets create a structured way for children to practice and develop their fine motor skills. As they follow guided letters and shapes, they gradually build muscle memory in their fingers and hands. This approach activates several sensory systems at once: the eyes interpret the shapes, while the sense of touch and body awareness guide hand movements more precisely."
