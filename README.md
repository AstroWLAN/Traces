## Abstract ðŸ’­
Traces is an Xcode app playground designed to help kids practice their handwriting skills transforming traditional tracing sheets into a fun experience. Using an iPad and the Apple Pencil, it offers a fresh and interactive way to learn leaving pen and paper behind!
> This app was submitted to the Apple Swift Student Challenge 2025, but unfortunately it didnâ€™t make it into the 350 worldwide winners. Iâ€™m truly grateful for the experience though! I got to spend a good amount of time working on something I really love.<br>
Huge congrats to all the winners for their stunning projects! ðŸ¥³
